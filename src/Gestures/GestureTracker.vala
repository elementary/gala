/**
 * Allow to use multi-touch gestures from different sources (backends).
 * Usage:
 * - Create a new instance of the class
 * - Use the enable_* methods to enable different backends
 * - Connect the on_gesture_detected to your code
 * - When on_gesture_detected is emitted, if you want to handle the gesture, call connect_handlers
 *   to start receiving events
 * - on_begin will be emitted once right after on_gesture_detected
 * - on_update will be emitted 0 or more times
 * - on_end will be emitted once when the gesture end
 * - When on_end is emitted, the handler connected with connect_handlers will be automatically
 *   disconnected and you will only receive on_gesture_detected signals
 * - The enabled flag is usually disabled on_end and re-enabled once the end animation finish. In
 *   this way, new gestures are not received while animating
